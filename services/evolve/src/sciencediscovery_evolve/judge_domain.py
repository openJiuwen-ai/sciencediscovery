"""Scoring by a model against a rubric — the mode that needs no dataset.

This is what makes `/evolve` work on things that are not programs over tables:
a prompt, an abstract, a protocol, a plan. There is nothing to execute and
nothing to measure, so a judge model reads the candidate against a frozen rubric
and gives it a number.

It is also the only **non-deterministic** mode, and five things follow from
that. None of them is optional, and each is here because leaving it out fails
quietly:

1. **Blind.** The judge is shown the rubric and the candidate, and nothing else
   — no index, no iteration, no parent's score. Tell a judge that this is
   "version 7, the previous scored 0.8" and "newer is better" becomes a
   self-fulfilling ranking.
2. **Median of several gradings, not one.** A single sample of a noisy scorer is
   a coin flip that the tree will treat as a measurement.
3. **Spread over the threshold is *undecidable*, not zero.** Zero says "this
   candidate is bad"; the truth is "this scorer could not tell". Recording the
   first turns noise into a ranking signal and poisons the denominator.
4. **The rubric is frozen and out of reach.** The candidate is never executed
   here, so it cannot rewrite the thing grading it — but the rubric also has to
   be in the goal's frozen set, or a later mutation of the *goal* could.
5. **A lower solved threshold.** A graded scorer rarely reaches 0.999, and at
   that default every rollout asks for a proposal and the run reports
   `below-threshold` — which reads as the reflector failing when in fact nothing
   was ever counted as solved.

A shard here is one independent grading. For a dataset a shard is a group of
rows; for a judge there is one artifact and the independence has to come from
repetition, so the split's shard counts are how many times each role grades.
