"""Turning a scorecard into the one number the engine ranks on, and the veto it
does not.

**This side is the authority.** The control plane has the same formulas in
TypeScript for the wizard's preview and its structural checks, but the numbers a
run is actually decided by are computed here, where the measurements are. The
two are kept honest by a shared fixture that both sides assert against
(`tests/fixtures/scorecard-golden.json`), so a change to one that the other does
not follow fails a test rather than drifting quietly.

Two paths out of one card:

* the weighted aggregate, in ``[0, 1]``, which is what ``evolve()`` ranks and
  what the Beta-posterior gate reads;
* the constraint verdicts, which decide **only** whether a candidate may merge.

A violating candidate keeps its score. Writing the veto as "score 0" would make
every violating candidate tie, and the tree's exploitation term reads *ranks* —
so the tie would flatten exactly the signal the search steers by, and "crashed"
would become indistinguishable from "promising but illegal".
