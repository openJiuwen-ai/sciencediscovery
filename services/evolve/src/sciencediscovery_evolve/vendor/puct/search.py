"""`futs.search`'s loop body as a Strategy plus an Aggregator.

Vendored from `examples/era/era_empirical_software.py` (see `__init__.py` for
the upstream commit). This is the part of the port that answers "how does the
tree search get workers, staleness and a barrier-free runtime" — and upstream's
answer is that it does not implement any of them: the loop body becomes an
`AggregatorProtocol`, `aggregator_factory` plugs it in, and `evolve` /
`async_evolve` supply the rest.

**Why this is vendored rather than re-implemented.** The two halves have to
agree about things that are not obvious from either one alone: that the parent
is chosen inside `propose` so a visit is reserved on the worker thread that will
use it; that a failed candidate still becomes a node so the rank denominator is
unchanged; that a card arriving late is still a legitimate expansion of the
parent it was drawn from and so has nothing to be stale against. Re-deriving
those is how a port stops being the algorithm it claims to be.

**What changed on the way in**, and nothing else:

* An ``on_event`` hook. Upstream writes a JSON result file at the end; this has
  to stream the search as it happens, because a `SubTask` binds a graph that a
  user watches being drawn. The hook fires where the facts already are — the
  parent in `propose`, the node and the decision in the aggregator — and it is
  the only reason any of this is not a copy.
* The task-specific half is gone. Upstream's `Splits`, `evaluate_source` and
  Kaggle prompt are replaced by the :class:`Domain`, which upstream already cut
  as the seam for exactly this.
* `ARTIFACT_ID` is per search, because one process runs many.

    Runs on a worker thread. The selection happens **here**, not in the
    aggregator, because `PuctTree.select_parent` reserves the visit as it picks —
    upstream's parallel virtual loss — and the thread that is about to spend
    minutes on this parent is the one that should have reserved it.

    ``complete`` is ``(prompt, iteration) -> (code, change_summary, promise)``;
    the engine owns the model call so that a stop, a token count and an empty
    reply all mean something to it. ``promise`` is the model's own rating of the
    direction, read out of the same reply — `P(s, a)` for `FlatPuct`, and
    ``None`` when the run did not ask for one or the model did not answer.

    **The fix-it loop is here, on the worker, and it is off unless a caller
    supplies ``check``.** Upstream appends a candidate that fails as a node
    scoring `-inf` and moves on; a task asks for the loop when that is too
    wasteful. Why a task would: a `-inf` node is a permanent dead end — its
    rank_score is 0, `FlatPuct` never selects it again, and the direction dies
    with it, even when the failure was a missing cast or a step size slightly
    too large.

    Two things about where it runs, and both are the reason it moved here from
    the aggregator:

    * **``check`` reads a rollout shard, never the held-out ones.** A loop that
      measured on the gate would be choosing between attempts on the split that
      decides the ranking, and a repaired candidate's gate score would be a
      maximum over three measurements where an unrepaired one's is a single
      measurement. That is a thumb on the scale of the search's own ordering.
    * **On a worker, in parallel.** The merger is one thread by the protocol's
      contract, and a repair costs a model call plus an evaluation. Spent there,
      nothing merges while it runs — and proposals waiting in the buffer go
      stale and are discarded, which is a second model call thrown away for
      every one this saved.

    The last draw is the one that goes forward, not the best of them: the loop
    buys attempts, it does not hide a failure. If they run out, the candidate
    becomes the `-inf` node upstream would have appended on the first one.
