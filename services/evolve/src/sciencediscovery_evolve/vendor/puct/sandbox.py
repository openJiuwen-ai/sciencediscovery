"""What actually confines a candidate.

Lifted from `examples/era/_era_support.py` (see `__init__.py` for the upstream
commit), with one deliberate change: **the backend is supplied by the caller
rather than probed here.**

Upstream asks `shutil.which("bwrap")` and assumes the answer means it works.
This repository has already paid for the knowledge that it does not: inside a
container, bwrap may need `--disable-userns`, and a fresh procfs mount can be
refused so the profile has to fall back to a bind. That knowledge lives in the
Node-side probe (`packages/sandbox-capability`), which runs once and hands the
result down with the run request. Asking twice, in two languages, is how the two
answers start to disagree.

.. danger:: The AST gate is not the boundary here, and must not be read as one.

   This workload needs pandas, numpy and scikit-learn — a stack that can read
   files and spawn processes — so admitting it admits most of what a gate would
   otherwise stop. What confines a candidate is this file: **Bubblewrap** on
   Linux, **Seatbelt** on macOS, both denying network access and confining
   writes to a scratch directory, with CPU / address-space / file-size / fd /
   process limits applied by the runner inside.

   The Bubblewrap profile binds the root **read-only** rather than a handful of
   directories: a candidate's imports live wherever the interpreter was
   installed, and enumerating those would be a guess that fails differently on
   every host. Reads are therefore open on both platforms; writes and the
   network are not. That is a weaker boundary than a per-directory allowlist and
   it is stated rather than glossed.

   It is checked against the kernel rather than by reading the profile back —
   see `tests/test_puct_sandbox.py`.
