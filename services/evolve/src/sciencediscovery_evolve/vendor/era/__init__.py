"""Vendored ERA port from AgentDescent.

Upstream: https://github.com/Birfy/agentdescent @ b3d4240
Files:    examples/era/era_empirical_software.py, examples/era/_era_support.py,
          examples/era/_era_runner.py

**Why vendored rather than imported.** The algorithm bodies live under
`examples/`, which the wheel does not package (`pyproject.toml` only ships
`agentdescent*`), and examples explicitly do not promise API stability. The
engine itself — `evolve()`, `FlatPuct`, `Ledger`, the verifier and the policies —
*is* imported from the installed package; only the port is copied.

**What changed on the way in**, and nothing else:

* The task is gone. Upstream is hard-wired to Kaggle Playground S3E1 (the
  `MedHouseVal` target, the 80/20 head/tail split, RMSE); this port takes its
  objective from the scorecard instead, so `prepare_splits`, `run_candidate`
  and `evaluate_source` are not here.
* `_era_runner.py` is copied **byte for byte**. See the note in that file: it
  encodes a non-obvious CPU-budget interaction, and a rewrite fails in a way
  that looks like poor candidate quality.
* Imports are rewritten for this package's layout.

The upstream tests came with it (`tests/test_era_fidelity.py`): the two
`futs_test.py` fixtures, the line-by-line reproduction of `futs.search`, and the
gate/parser checks. Moving the code without them would discard the
`benchmark_faithful` claim, which is the only reason to vendor rather than
re-implement.

**What is here now.** The tree, the AST gate, the sandbox, the runner — and
`search.py`, which is `futs.search`'s loop body as the Strategy and Aggregator
that `evolve` / `async_evolve` plug in. That last file is the answer to "where
do workers, staleness and a barrier-free runtime come from": upstream does not
implement any of them, it hands the loop body to the engine through
`aggregator_factory` and lets the engine supply the rest.

`domain.py` is the seam upstream cut so a second task could run on the same
loop. Here the one implementation is the user's scorecard
(`sciencediscovery_evolve.scorecard_domain`), which is what the seam is for.
