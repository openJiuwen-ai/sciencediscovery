"""The candidate program: its identity, the AST gate, and the reply parser.

Lifted from `examples/era/_era_support.py` (see `__init__.py` for the upstream
commit). The task-specific half of that module — the S3E1 data preparation and
the RMSE evaluator — is deliberately absent: what a candidate is measured on
comes from the scorecard here, not from a hard-wired benchmark.

.. danger:: The gate is not the security boundary, and must not be read as one.

   This benchmark needs pandas, numpy and scikit-learn — a stack that can read
   files and spawn processes — so admitting it admits most of what a gate would
   otherwise stop. What the gate still buys is that the ordinary accidents (a
   candidate that shells out, calls ``open``, or reaches for a dunder) fail
   in-process with a readable message instead of inside the sandbox.

   What actually confines a candidate is the sandbox, which lands with the
   commit that executes candidates for real.

#: Wide enough for the benchmark, and no wider. Upstream ships no gate at all --
#: `sandbox.py` is an abstract class that raises -- so every name here is this
#: port's decision, and the trade is explicit: admitting scikit-learn admits a
#: package that can spawn processes and read files, which is why the sandbox
#: profile rather than this set is the actual boundary.
#: Modules a candidate may never import, whatever is installed.
#:
#: A deny list, because the allow list this replaced was a guess and the guess
#: was wrong in the expensive direction. It named thirteen modules — no
#: `xgboost`, no `lightgbm`, no `catboost`, no `statsmodels` — which are exactly
#: what a model reaches for on a tabular task. Refusing them cost candidates on
#: every real run, and once cost a whole run: a drafted starting point imported
#: `catboost`, the gate refused it, and the probe reported that the starting
#: point would not run.
#:
#: The gate is explicitly *not* the isolation boundary — bubblewrap and Seatbelt
#: are, and this module's own docstring says so. So refusing an import was never
#: a security decision; it was a claim that the import would not work here, and
#: for an installed package that claim is simply false. What is left on this
#: list is the handful that reach outside the process: they die against the
#: sandbox profile anyway, and failing in-process with a readable message is the
#: whole reason this gate exists.
