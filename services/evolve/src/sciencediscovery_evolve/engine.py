"""The seam every search engine plugs into, and one rule about how to call it.

An engine is handed a :class:`RunSpec`, an ``emit`` callback and a
``should_stop`` predicate, and is expected to emit the event sequence described
in ``events.py``. Two implementations: ``stub_engine`` (deterministic, executes
nothing) and ``puct_engine``; the OpenEvolve port lands behind the same seam
later.

.. danger:: Parallel expansion uses AgentDescent's ``ThreadExecutor``.

   Its actors are supplied through ``attach_actors`` rather than through the
   spec's ``Ref``s, because a closure has no name to resolve. **Only an
   in-process executor accepts a directly-supplied callable.** This is written
   here rather than discovered later because the obvious "optimisation" — swap
   the thread pool for processes to get around the GIL — turns every rollout
   into an unresolvable-reference crash, and the failure surfaces far from the
   edit that caused it.

   Threads are the right tool regardless: the two slow things are a blocking
   HTTP call to a model and ``subprocess.run`` for a sandboxed candidate. Both
   release the GIL, and neither has an asyncio-native path in this stack.
