"""The event stream this sidecar emits, and its NDJSON encoding.

Mirrors ``EvolveEvent`` / ``EvolveEventRecord`` in ``packages/schema`` — the Node
API parses exactly these shapes. Kept as plain dicts built by small helpers
rather than as pydantic models: the union has ten arms whose only consumer is
``json.dumps``, and a second schema definition here would be a second thing to
keep in sync.

Two encoding rules that are **not** style choices:

* ``-inf`` never goes on the wire. ``json.dumps`` writes it as the bare token
  ``-Infinity``, which is not valid JSON and which strict parsers (including
  ``JSON.parse``) reject. A failed candidate carries ``score: null`` and is
  marked ``valid: false``; the node still enters the tree, because dropping it
  would change the rank denominator of every later iteration.
* Counters are **absolute, never deltas**. ``visits`` (and, for openevolve, cell
  occupancy) are the only non-idempotent quantities in the system; a replayed
  delta double-counts where a replayed absolute does not. That is what lets the
  API drop everything at or below its watermark and lets a mid-run Neo4j outage
  be repaired by replaying the log.
