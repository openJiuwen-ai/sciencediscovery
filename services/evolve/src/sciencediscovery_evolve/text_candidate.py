"""Reading a rewritten *text* out of a model's reply.

The fence handling is shared with the program path — `vendor/puct/program.py`
owns the regex, because it is upstream's and the two must agree about what a
block is. What differs is where the summary comes from: a program carries one
in its module docstring, and a prompt or an abstract has no docstring, so the
line before the fence is used instead.

With no fence at all the whole reply is the candidate. Discarding a perfectly
good rewrite over formatting is the worse failure.
