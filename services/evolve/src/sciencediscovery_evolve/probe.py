"""Does this scorecard have any ordering power?

Score the starting point, then score a copy that was deliberately made worse.
Two numbers that come back the same mean the scoring cannot separate a good
candidate from a bad one, and a search on flat terrain is a random walk that
looks completely normal from outside: every event fires, every candidate is
recorded, the dashboard shows a search that simply found nothing.

That is why this is worth two evaluations up front. The other pre-flight checks
catch failures that announce themselves — a wrong scale makes the engine throw,
a wrong direction is caught by the normalisation table. This one is the silent
case, and it was not hypothetical: the first judged run gave four candidates in
a row full marks, so the tree had no signal after the first expansion.

The damage is deliberately crude. Being subtle would be measuring something
else: a scorecard that cannot see a predictor replaced by a constant is not
going to separate two real candidates.
